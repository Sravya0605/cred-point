# Overview

This is a Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Management Platform built with Flask. It allows cybersecurity professionals to track their continuing education requirements across multiple certification authorities (ISCÂ², EC-Council, CompTIA, OffSec, etc.). Users can log CPE activities, monitor progress toward renewal requirements, and generate professional reports for compliance purposes.

## Key Features (August 2025)
- **Real-World Recommendations**: Dynamic fetching of live CPE opportunities from certification authorities and training providers
- **Intelligent Activity Verification**: Automated verification and CPE point calculation based on authority-specific rules
- **Professional PDF Reports**: Certification-specific formatted reports with QR codes for verification
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Ultra-fast loading with critical CSS inlining and optimized database queries
- **File Upload & Verification**: Secure proof document handling with verification status tracking
